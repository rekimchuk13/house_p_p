# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Description
This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, location, and more. Using the `Housing.csv` dataset, we developed a machine learning model to assist both buyers and sellers in understanding the market value of real estate properties better.

## How to Use
To run this project, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/rekimchuk13/house_p_p.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Execute `main.py` to run the prediction model:
python main.py

## Project Files
- `Housing.csv` - The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `tech_task.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and model development process.
- `main.py` - The main Python script for running the prediction model.

## Technologies
This project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
